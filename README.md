# chaos-hunter
This Bash script automates the retrieval of target data from the Chaos project . It downloads an index file, fetches URLs for target data, extracts the archives, and compiles the results into a single file. Useful for cybersecurity researchers and bug bounty hunters to identify subdomains and potential attack surfaces.
